# SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF CARCASSES USING DEEP LEARNING

For source code refer to .py files. 
For a light demonstration refer to the notebook (Demonstration.ipynb)

## Caveats
Our project supervisor does not want us to include images. But a few samples can be seen in Demonstration.ipynb. Similarly we have not included the final weights as these are valuable to the company and should not be public.
